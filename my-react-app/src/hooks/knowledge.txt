Hook were added to React in version 16.8
Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods

Hook Rules:
1. Can only be called inside React function components
2. Can only be called at the top level of a components
3. Cannot be conditional

--> Hook will not work in React clas components

--------------------useState --------------------

The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function components.
State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application
useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:
- The current state.
- A function that updates the state.
The useState Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects,
and any combination of these

When state is updated, the entrie state gets overwritten
If we only called setCar({color: "blue}), this would remove the brand, model, and year from our state
--> We can use the Javascript spread operator to help us
